The EPS integration provides connectivity with alarm systems based on [EPS](https://www.eps.fr/). Some other companies (ex: Homiris) distribute those systems.

This platform supports the following services:

- `alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_away`
- `alarm_control_panel.alarm_arm_night`
- `alarm_control_panel.alarm_disarm`
